# voting-app

questions:

would like someone to look at my vote routes and tests.  

# vote routes:

1. why in my paths (ex. line 97) do I not need to put ._id in the template literal in some places, but I do in others (ie poll.test.js line 114)?

1. is my res.body correct for these?  am I returning too much info?
